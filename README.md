Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the application of systemic engineering principles, methods and tools in the development of software solutions
its importance is that it enables the creation of high quality software solutions that helps in problems solving

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of programming languages
2. Development of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements gatheering. gathering and documenting necessary features to the users.
2. Design. Creating high quality mock ups and architecture of the software
3. Development. Writing code that will give rise to the designed software
4. Testing. conducting quality tests on the standards of the software ensuring it meets all the erquirements
5. Implentation. releasing the software to the users
6. Maintenance. providing continuous support, and enhancement to the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach while agile is an iterative and incremental approch focussed on flexibility and response to changes

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a software developer, a , and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer writes code that will execute the software solution
Quality Assurance Engineer carries out quality test on the software by writing code that tests it
Project Manager oversees the implementation of the software from requirement gatheering to deployment

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools for writing, debugging and testing codes example is   visual studio
VCS is tools that track changes made to the source code of a software eg git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. changing requirements
2. tight deadlines
3. technical debts
Strategies to overcome these challanges
Regualar reassessment of project goal
effective communication
prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing
testing individual modules of a software
intergration testing
testing the interaction between the diffrent modules of a software
acceptance testing
testing a software against the requirements of the users to see if they are met
Importance
helps identify and fix problems in the sofware before deployment
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the crafting of clear and concise questions that will be asked to an AI so as to get the most appropriate response.
importance
helps AI to understand what one needs 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt 
"What is the best tourist destination in kenya"
concise
"What is the best tourist destinations in kenya where one can see the flamingos and hot springs "
the improved prompt will give a very clear location of where the place is since more details has been provided to the AI to help it in decision making
